# The Flowerpot Mod

This is a mod that adds a heap of decorative pots filled with flowers, trees, mushrooms, and more. The arrangements come in themed pots which can be customized after placing.

The mod adds:
* 14 Flowerpots
* 11 Treepots
* 4 Shroompots
* 4 Plantpots
* 3 Flowers
* 1 Mushroom

Three growpots allow you to grow cherries, cocoa beans, and mushrooms in any season.

# **TIPS**
* **Cherry, Cocoa, and Shroom pots need to be bonemealed** in order to grow produce.

*In creative, use a golden apple on a flowering pot to make it instantly fruit.*

* **Cherry and Cocoa need at least light level 5 to grow**, and Shrooms need the light level to be lower than 10 and/or be shielded from the sun.


* **To mix and match flower arrangements**, right click a flowerpot with shears to remove its top. Tops can only be placed on pots.

*To avoid confusion, you cannot replant flowering and fruiting tops, only base ones that haven't been bonemealed.*

* **The new flowers** now spawn in the world. Wintergreen spawns in boreal forest and meadow, Glory spawns in tundra and taiga, and Nightshade spawns in rainforest and swamp. White Mushrooms spawn rarely under trees.

*Spawning requires TerrainAPI. Use the NoTerrainAPI .jar if you want them to be craftable.*


Block IDs span 14116 - 14227.

*Built using the Turnip Labs example mod.*
