# The Flowerpot Mod

This is a mod that adds a heap of decorative pots filled with flowers, trees, mushrooms, and more. The arrangements come in themed pots which can be customized after placing.

The mod adds:
* 14 Flowerpots
* 11 Treepots
* 4 Shroompots
* 2 Plantpots
* 3 Flowers\*
* 1 Mushroom\*

Three growpots allow you to grow cherries, cocoa beans, and mushrooms in any season.

\*Don't spawn, must be crafted.

# **TIPS**
* **Cherry, Cocoa, and Shroom pots need to be bonemealed** in order to grow produce.

*In creative, use a golden apple on a flowering pot to make it instantly fruit.*

* **Cherry and Cocoa need at least light level 5 to grow**, and Shrooms need the light level to be lower than 10 and/or be shielded from the sun.


* **To mix and match flower arrangements**, right click a flowerpot with shears to remove its top. Tops can only be placed on pots.

*To avoid confusion, you cannot replant flowering and fruiting tops, only base ones that haven't been bonemealed.*

* **To obtain the new flowers and shroom**, you must 'cross breed' them in a workbench. Press U on dandelions and mushrooms to see their recipes.

*They do not spawn in the world in this version.*
